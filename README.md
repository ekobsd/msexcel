# Practical Excel 365 for Beginners

## About the Course

This is a practical, non-material course designed to train Excel 365. It comes with 3 simple philosophies:

- Start as small as possible, then go long expanding your horizons.
- Action first: Try, fail, fail more, learn.
- search only what you need, forget the rest of the complex theory.

## Fun Fact

There are 1000 pages of Excel book on the shelf, but we never opened it. 

With Excel, knowing 10% allows most to do 90% of our needs.

## Problem-solving framework

Pick a real-world problem, and try to solve it!

When you find yourself facing errors:
- Define your error and the goal that you want to achieve.
- Search Google for the same problem
- learn the logic of how the people share the solution for it
